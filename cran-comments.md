## Update

-   I've incremented the version to indicate that it's out of the beta testing stage.
-   The README file and vignettes have been streamlined.
-   Examples are now tested.
-   Codebook data files have been significantly compacted.

## Test environments

-   local windows install (x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit)), R 4.2.1

-   Ubuntu 22.04.2, Microsoft Windows Server 2022 10.0.20348, macOS 12.6.5 (via GitHub's R CMD Check workflow)

## Reverse dependency

-   version 0.2.0 of this package was archived because it required archived package 'timetk'. That dependency has been removed
