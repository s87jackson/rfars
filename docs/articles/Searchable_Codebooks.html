<p>It can be helpful to search the codebooks for certain concepts. For
example, below we print out all entries related to speed. This helps
find relevant crashes for analysis and shows how variables change over
time.</p>

However, the data element is currently in the database for these 2 years with all data as missing. With this data element there has always been a high number of unknown cases. Since the data were considered somewhat \"uncollectible,\" a decision was made not to collect the data for these 2 years. However, although the data were often unavailable, it was considered too important not to try to collect it.
